## Results: Customer Retention & Repeat Purchase Analysis

### Executive summary

Most customers only place one order, but repeat customers still account for a slightly larger share of total revenue. While repeat buyers represent a smaller portion of the customer base, their additional purchases make up for the fact that order values stay about the same. Overall, revenue growth here is driven by getting customers to come back, not by higher spend per order.

### Key findings

- About 69.5% of customers place only one order, while roughly 30.5% return for at least one additional purchase.
- Repeat customers generate just over half of total revenue at 50.8%, compared to 49.2% from one-time customers.
- The typical gap between a first and second order is long, with a median of 240 days and an average of around 381 days.
- Average order value is almost identical for first and repeat orders, at $86.33 and $86.68 respectively.
- Most customers drop off after their first purchase, with far fewer customers reaching three or more orders.
- Customers who place multiple orders make up a small share of users but contribute a meaningful portion of revenue.

### Business implications

- Improving retention would have a clear impact on revenue, since repeat customers already contribute more than half of total sales.
- Shortening the time between first and second purchases could significantly increase customer lifetime value.
- Because order values stay flat, growth efforts should focus on encouraging additional purchases rather than upselling.
- Follow-up and re-engagement campaigns may be especially important given how long customers take to return.
