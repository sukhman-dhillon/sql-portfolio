# Results: Marketing Funnel & Conversion Analysis

## Executive summary
Most revenue comes from Search and Organic traffic. While channels differ a lot in scale, customer behavior is broadly similar across sources. Average order value and customer value do not vary much by channel, suggesting growth is mainly driven by volume rather than higher spend per customer.

## Key findings
- Search is the largest channel by a wide margin, generating about $5.65M in revenue from 65,577 orders.
- Organic traffic is the second largest source, contributing roughly $1.23M in revenue and 14,017 orders.
- Average order value is very consistent across channels, generally falling between $85 and $88.
- Around 29–30% of customers return across all traffic sources, indicating similar retention patterns.
- Average revenue per customer is slightly higher for Organic ($124.03) and Facebook ($123.79) compared to Search.
- High-value orders ($150+) make up roughly 15–16% of orders for all channels, with only small differences between them.
- When traffic is grouped at a higher level, Organic/Other channels account for most revenue ($7.29M), while Paid channels contribute a much smaller share ($810K) with similar AOV.
- Revenue and order volume are spread fairly evenly across the week, with a small mid-week peak but no strong day-specific pattern.

## Business implications
- Search and Organic channels should remain the primary focus, as they drive most revenue without showing weaker customer quality.
- Because order value and customer value are similar across channels, growth efforts should prioritize increasing volume rather than expecting higher spend from specific sources.
- Facebook and Organic show slightly higher customer value, which may support testing higher-end products or upsell strategies within those channels.
- Paid channels generate comparable AOV but much lower volume, suggesting a need to improve targeting or efficiency before increasing spend.
- Marketing activity does not need to be heavily optimized by day of week, though mid-week launches may perform slightly better.
